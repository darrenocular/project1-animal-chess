      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the jungle. This is a game of chess, played with opposing
        factions of animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with any society, high and low, there is a hierarchy. In this
        make-believe world, where mindless vying for power has descended upon
        its inhabitants, some semblance of normalcy (or so we think) has been
        given by God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order of power:
        <strong>Elephant, Lion, Tiger, Leopard, Wolf, Dog, Cat and Rat</strong>.
        So, the Elephant can "kill" another Elephant (and all other weaker
        animals), while the Lion can "kill" another Lion (and all other weaker
        animals) but not the Elephant, and so forth. Some have been blessed with
        size, while others haven't. <em>Size matters.</em>
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Animal (in order of power)</th>
          <th>Piece</th>

          <td>Cat</td>
          <td><img src="assets/cat.png" class="piece black-piece" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Rat</td>
          <td><img src="assets/rat.png" class="piece black-piece" /></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        With perhaps the exception of the Rat. As an old Chinese legend goes,
        the Rat has the ability to scurry into the Elephant's ear and gnaw at
        its brain. So, while the Elephant is the strongest in the field, the
        Elephant's Achilles' heel comes unfortunately in the form of the little
        one - the Rat. The Elephant cannot "kill" the Rat under any
        circumstances.

      <h3>How to win?</h3>
      <p>
        Win by either moving any one of your animals into the opponent's den or
        wiping the jungle clean of all the opponent's animals.
      </p>
      <h3>Detailed gameplay</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may move a piece during every turn. All pieces can only move 1
          square horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). However, note the
          special rules for the river below.
        </li>
        <li>An animal <strong>cannot</strong> move into its own den.</li>
        <li>
          All animals can move into either player's trap squares. An animal that
          enters any of the <strong>opponent's</strong> trap squares is
          <strong>reduced in rank to 0</strong>. It can be "killed" by any of
          the opponent's pieces (regardless of hierarchy) and does not have the
          power to "kill" any of the opponent's adjacent pieces. A trapped piece
          has its normal power restored when it exits the opponent's trap
          square.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are special rules for the river: (1) <em>only</em> the Rat can
          enter the river; and (2) <em>only</em> the Lion and the Tiger can jump
          over a river to the next non-water square on the other side (and
          "kill" an opponent's animal of equal or lower rank). But a jumping
          move is <strong>blocked</strong> if there is a Rat (of either player)
          in the intervening water squares.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because only the Rat can enter the river, a Rat in the river can only
          be killed by another Rat in the river.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Rat can <em>only</em> "kill" the Elephant
          <strong>from land and not the river</strong>. This means that the Rat
          cannot move from the river to "kill" an Elephant on an adjacent
          non-water square.
        </li>
      </ul>
